School doesn't teach you how to make money, school teaches you to be an employee and to pay taxes, rich people do not pay taxes.

Yes! The masses have only one stream of income because society has raised us to be employees and you must go to school and work for "the man." They also raise us to equate wealth with a nice house and a nice car. I have my 9-5 but I am using it to fund my real estate investments and educating myself more!
