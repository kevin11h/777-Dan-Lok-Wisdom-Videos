Please understand that by watching Dan’s videos or enrolling in his programs does not mean you’ll get results close to what he’s been able to do (or do anything for that matter).

He’s been in business for over 20 years and his results are not typical.

Most people who watch his videos or enroll in his programs get the “how to” but never take action with the information. Dan is only sharing what has worked for him and his students.
 
Your results are dependent on many factors… including but not limited to your ability to work hard, commit yourself, and do whatever it takes.
 
Entering any business is going to involve a level of risk as well as massive commitment and action. If you're not willing to accept that, please DO NOT WATCH DAN’S VIDEOS OR SIGN UP FOR ONE OF HIS PROGRAMS.

School doesn't teach you how to make money, school teaches you to be an employee and to pay taxes, rich people do not pay taxes.

Yes! The masses have only one stream of income because society has raised us to be employees and you must go to school and work for "the man." They also raise us to equate wealth with a nice house and a nice car. I have my 9-5 but I am using it to fund my real estate investments and educating myself more!
